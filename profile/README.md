## Libris

Libris is an advanced documentation generation tool that automates the process of code documentation. It is designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing code development workflow, making it easy for developers to generate comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.

Libris works by analyzing the codebase and extracting relevant information, such as function signatures, class hierarchies, and variable descriptions. It then organizes this information into a structured and user-friendly format, generating documentation that is easy to navigate and understand. Libris supports multiple programming languages, making it a versatile tool for different development environments.
